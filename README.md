# Super Mario World resources
Patches and other resources for Super Mario World hacking.

## Feature requests

Feature requests to extend existing resources in this repository are welcome, but they must have general usability for a wider
audience than yourself. Super-specific requests will not be considered. Furthermore, requests for completely new patches or
resources will not be considered.

## Bug reports

Bug reports are welcome. Interoperability between my patches and other resources is not guaranteed; first reproduce the bug using
only the offending patch and the supported tools and patches. **Do not submit a bug report if you cannot reproduce the bug within
these constraints.** Provide at least a thorough description of how you prepared your ROM image and how to reproduce the bug in
game. For easy reproduction, it is preferred that you also provide a patch where the bug can be easily reproduced. **Please, do not
post ROM images for this or any other purpose.**

Supported tools and patches:

* Lunar Magic 3.10
* Asar 1.71
* SA-1 Pack 1.32

## Pull requests

Pull requests are welcome! Please describe in sufficient detail what issue your pull request is addressing. Be extra careful about
adding completely new features, as I intend for my patches to have minimal impact. Stay within scope!
