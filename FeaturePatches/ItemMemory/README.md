# Item Memory

Replaces the item memory system in Super Mario World with a different system that assigns a bit to every individual tile in a stage,
rather than having columns within a screen share the same bit. Also implements item memory settings 3. Implements a flag that can be
used to toggle the use of item memory. Compatible with the ExLevel system implemented by recent versions of Lunar Magic.
